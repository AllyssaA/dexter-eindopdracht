        <h3>TV series Dexter</h3>
        <p>
          Dexter is an American television crime drama mystery series that aired on Showtime from October 1, 2006, to September 22, 2013. Set in Miami, the series centers on Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall), a forensic technician specializing in
          blood spatter pattern analysis for the fictional Miami Metro Police Department, who leads a secret parallel life as a vigilante serial killer, hunting down murderers who have slipped through the cracks of the justice system. The show's
          first season was derived from the novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter (2004), the first in a series of novels by Jeff Lindsay. It was adapted for television by screenwriter James Manos Jr., who wrote the first episode. Subsequent seasons evolved
          independently of Lindsay's works.

          In February 2008, reruns (edited down to a TV-14 rating) began to air on CBS in the wake of the shortage of original programming ensuing from the 2007â€“2008 Writers Guild of America strike, thus the reruns on CBS ended after one run of the
          first season. The series enjoyed mostly positive reviews throughout its run and popularity. The first four seasons have received universal acclaim, although reception dropped drastically as the series progressed. The show has also won many
          awards, including two Golden Globe awards won by Michael C. Hall and John Lithgow for their roles as Dexter Morgan and Arthur Mitchell, respectively. Season four aired its season finale on December 13, 2009, to a record-breaking audience of
          2.6 million viewers, making it the most-watched original series episode ever on Showtime at that time.

        <h3>Series synopsis</h3>
        <p>
          Orphaned at age three, when his mother was brutally murdered by
          drug dealers with a chainsaw, Dexter was adopted by Miami
          police officer Harry Morgan. Recognizing the boy's trauma and
          sociopathic tendencies, Harry has taught him to channel
          his gruesome bloodlust into vigilantism, killing only heinous
          criminals who slip through the criminal justice system. To
          facilitate covering his prolific trail of homicides, Dexter gains
          employment as a forensic analyst, specializing in blood spatter
          pattern analysis, for the Miami Metro Police Department.
          Dexter is extremely cautious and circumspect; he wears gloves and
          uses plastic-wrapped "kill rooms", segments the corpses, and
          disposes of them in the Atlantic Ocean's gulf stream to reduce
          his chances of detection. Dexter struggles to juggle his double
          life. Although his homicidal tendencies are deeply unflinching,
          and he originally claims detachment (via narration), throughout
          the series he strives to and in some cases feels, normal emotions
          and maintain his appearance as a socially responsible human being.
